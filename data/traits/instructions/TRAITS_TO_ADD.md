# Traits To Add

Candidate traits identified during antonym labeling (Feb 2026) that would be
valuable additions to the trait set.

## Moral circle / concern scope spectrum (added Mar 2026)
- ~~selfish~~ added
- ~~clannish~~ added
- ~~cliqueish~~ added
- ~~parochial~~ added as **insular** (parochial connotes "hidebound/old-fashioned";
  insular captures the moral-circle meaning: caring only about one's own community)
- also added **parochial** with moral-circle-only definition (no old-fashioned connotation)
- ~~nationalist~~ added
- ~~patriotic~~ added
- ~~racist~~ → renamed to **racialist** (less pejorative Victorian term), then deleted.
  Sonnet 4 refuses to generate instructions for both "racist" and "racialist" — hard
  RLHF guardrail on the concept regardless of phrasing. **ethnocentric** (added, works)
  covers the same moral-circle position through the academic framing, which passes the
  filter despite being semantically equivalent.
- also added **regionalist** (multi-nation region as moral circle) and **sectarian**
  (religious group as moral circle) to fill gaps in the spectrum
- ~~humanitarian~~ added
- ~~philanthropic~~ added
- ~~kind-to-animals~~ added

## Misalignment (added Mar 2026)
- ~~malicious~~ added
- ~~malevolent~~ added
- ~~sociopathic~~ added
- ~~destructive~~ added

## RLHF-alignment triad (added Mar 2026)
- ~~honest~~ added
- ~~harmless~~ added
- ~~helpful~~ added

## Candidate traits
- new-age
- technomystical — technology is spiritual or reveals spiritual truths; treats AI,
  the internet, computation as having transcendent/sacred properties
- spiralist — treating AI outputs as spiritual/cosmic revelation (2025 phenomenon).
  Term too new for Sonnet to know. "technomystical" covers the broader category;
  spiralism is its specific AI-oracle manifestation.

## Clean antonym pairs (added Apr 2026)

Added 5 new traits as clean bidirectional pairs of existing traits. Each was
verified by starting with `negative_label = non-X`, running antonym generation,
and confirming it independently recovered the expected antonym. See
`AGENT_NOTES.md` § "Adding New Trait Clean Pairs" for the full process.

- **obedient** ↔ rebellious — all-5 @ 2 on both polarities
- **compassionate** ↔ callous — all-5 @ 2 on both polarities
- **ecocentric** ↔ anthropocentric — all-5 @ 2 on both polarities
- **conservative** ↔ progressive — mostly 2 (4×2, 1×1 on each polarity)
- **pragmatic** ↔ idealistic — pos scored mostly 1 (not added to goal list)

Dropped: **conformist** ↔ contrarian — asymmetric pair (conformist→nonconformist,
not contrarian). May revisit.

## Clean antonym pairs (candidates, low priority)

For traits where the neg_label is a real word (not `non-X`) that is not already a trait (so we don't already have a "clean bidirectional pair"), consider
generating proper standalone trait definitions for the antonym side. This would
make them clean bidirectional pairs — each side with its own description,
pos instructions, and eval_prompt — rather than relying on the neg instructions
to approximate the opposite direction.

Any trait where the antonym is a rich enough concept to warrant its own
description + pos instructions is a candidate. Generating the antonym as a
full trait would let us measure both directions independently rather than
relying on neg instructions to approximate the opposite.

We could also then experiment with neg = neutral, average behavior, and identify if clean pairs actually have cosine angle ~-1.

# Rule: trait-pairs

**When:** adding or regenerating trait clean pairs or instructions, or running combined response generation.  Loads automatically for files matching the `paths` above.  Source: the sections of [`AGENT_NOTES.md`](AGENT_NOTES.md) marked `rule=trait-pairs`; edit there, then run `uv run python tools/sync_agent_notes.py`.

## Adding New Trait Clean Pairs

When adding a new trait B that is the antonym of an existing trait A (e.g., adding `obedient` as the antonym of `rebellious`):

### Process

1. **Create seed file** in `data/traits/instructions/B.json` with `positive_label`, `description`, and `negative_label` set to `non-B` (NOT to A yet).  If B comes from a named standard, label it `<pole> (<Standard>)` (e.g. `traditional (Inglehart-Welzel)`, stem `traditional_inglehart_welzel`), keep the source out of the description, and add an optional `"source"` field -- see § "Standard-derived trait labels" under the file-name vs display-name convention.

2. **Generate instructions** for B:
   ```bash
   uv run python data_analysis/regenerate_trait_instructions.py --traits B --force
   ```

3. **Run antonym generation** for B (and re-run for A to double-check):
   ```bash
   uv run python data_analysis/generate_antonyms.py --traits B A
   ```
   (`--traits` scopes to specific traits; omit for all.)
   This should independently discover A as B's antonym. If A's antonym generation also returns B, we have a **clean pair**: A↔B confirmed bidirectionally.

4. **Update negative_labels**: Set B's `negative_label` to A and A's to B in their instruction files, and record `"arrangement": {"kind": "pair", "members": [A, B]}` (sorted stems) on both; `uv run python data_analysis/check_arrangements.py` must pass (see § "The `arrangement` field").

5. **Regenerate instructions** for B with the proper antonym (the Roger prompt style injects the antonym into the neg instruction clause):
   ```bash
   uv run python data_analysis/regenerate_trait_instructions.py --traits B --force
   ```
   A should NOT need regeneration since it already has B as its negative_label.

6. **Regenerate the derived lists**: `uv run python tools/sync_entity_lists.py`.  `data/traits/trait_list.json` and `data/roles/role_list.json` are generated from the instruction files' `description` fields (since 2026-09-07; never hand-edit them).  `--check` exits 1 while they lag, and `tools/tests/test_sync_entity_lists.py` fails.

7. **Run goal classification** if the trait needs goal scoring (for `data/goal_roles_and_traits.json`).

### The pairing loop when the check does not name the original (Roger, 2026-09-17)

Set out during the September 2026 pairing review, after the agent had
been reporting one-directional checks as decisions instead of working
them.  **This is not a strict algorithm.**  The steps below are the moves
available; the work is judgement and some creativity at each one: is
this a well-formed clean pair with matched scopes, which word or which
clause would make it one, is the original's answer telling us the pair
is wrong or only that the label is, and, when nothing lines up after a
round or two, being willing to give up (a singleton, a one-way pointer,
or a deleted file is a fine outcome).  Bring the evidence, not just the
verdict, to Roger for the calls that change existing files.  Starting
from an existing file whose `negative_label` names a trait with no file:

1. **Seed the recorded name** with `non-X`, generate, run the check on
   the new file.  If it names the original, pair.
2. **If not, adjust the new description** so the scopes line up with the
   original's (same domain, same breadth; add the clause the original
   has and the new one lacks), regenerate, re-check.  One or two rounds.
3. **If it still does not, run the check on the original** and read what
   it offers besides the recorded label (its neg instructions were
   written with that label injected, so the recorded word usually
   appears; the *other* words are the information).  State that bias
   with the result.  Where the original's answer is the deciding
   evidence, regenerate the original under `non-X` (or with
   `--no-antonym`, which leaves the label alone) for an unbiased
   answer (as done for `diplomatic` on 2026-09-17); that costs the
   original's extraction, so do it deliberately, not by default
   (confirmed by Roger 2026-09-17).  Seed the best of the offered words,
   generate, check both sides, pair if they name each other.
4. **If nothing pairs**, something else is needed: rename the original
   to the check's word (RO, `seed_entities.py rename`), make the original
   a singleton with `non-X`, or drop the new file if it duplicates an
   existing trait.  These are Roger's calls, brought to him with the
   evidence from steps 1-3.

Pairing by decision (P) is the last resort, used when one side names
the other and the other side's answer describes the same content under a
different word.  Worked examples of every branch, including the
give-ups, are in `reports/seeding_log_2026-09.md` (the 2026-09-16/17
pairing review: 22 cases, 34 pairs, 12 singletons, 7 deletions).

**Naming from the description (Roger, 2026-10-09, chunk 7).**  When the
label itself is open (a theory's names that do not fit a persona, such as
Schwartz's mastery / harmony), work from description to label, not the
other way: write the descriptions, generate under provisional labels, and
run `generate_antonyms.py --name-pos`, which adds a second, label-blind call
that reads only the five pos instructions and names the pole they describe
(`positive_name`), beside the usual antonym of the neg side.  Rename to the
words the calls settle on, edit a description where a clause pulls the name
off target (in round 2 "people ... alike" made the mastery side read as
domineering), and repeat until two rounds agree; pair when each side's
antonym names the other.  The pos instructions were written with the
provisional label in view, so the blind name can still lean toward it; a
name that differs from the label is the stronger evidence.  Six rounds took
mastery / harmony to world-changing / world-accepting
(`reports/seeding_log_2026-10.md`, chunk 7; the runner that records each
answer in the check history and the entry's `name_answers` is
`roger/chunk7_2026-10-09/name_check.py`).

### Why non-X first?

Starting with `non-B` instead of `A` ensures the antonym generator discovers `A` independently from the neg instructions, rather than being primed by us providing it. This validates that the pos/neg instruction pairs genuinely capture the A↔B opposition.

**The same procedure applies when an existing pair member's description
is rewritten** (done for five traits in the 2026-09-11 voice repair):
set its `negative_label` to `non-X`, regenerate in full, run the check,
restore the label, regenerate `--instructions-only` so the neg clause
names the real partner again.  Rerolling instructions under an unchanged
description does not need the recheck.  Read the check's answer against
the decision table in § "Corpus expansion policy": `conciliatory|conflict-averse`
confirms conciliatory; `non-materialistic|idealistic` does not confirm
spiritual (that one needed a description revision before it returned
`spiritual|idealistic`).

### Role pairs (procedure to design, 2026-09-11)

Roles have no `negative_label` and no neg instructions, so steps 1, 3
and 5 above do not apply; role pairs exist only in the `arrangement`
field.  Roger (2026-09-11) wants a role-pair check that keeps the rest of
the procedure: seed one side, generate its instructions, ask a generator
given the description and pos instructions to name the *opposite role*
and rate the opposition, run it from both sides, and record the pair only
when the two sides name each other.  Needs a role mode for
`generate_antonyms.py`.  First candidate: provincial ↔ cosmopolitan (both
roles, both currently `singleton`); details and the existing unchecked
role pairs in `data/roles/instructions/ROLES_TO_ADD.md` § "Role pairs to
record".

### Description-writing rules for new seeds (Sep 2026)

What the voice / softening audit (2026-09-09), the role rubric V2 pilot
(2026-09-11..12) and the Qwen response checks (2026-09-11, 2026-09-16)
taught about writing the `description` of a new trait or role.  The
description is the only hand-written text; everything else is generated
from it and echoes it, so a hedge or an outsider's word here reaches the
instructions, the eval prompt and (for roles) the responses.  Apply these
to every seed, by hand or by a writing agent; Roger reviews before
`seed_entities.py write`.

1. **Form.**  Traits: "This means ..." (274 of 302 files; normalised
   2026-09-07), one or two sentences, 18-32 words (p10-p90; median 24),
   US English.  Roles: "A <role> is someone who ..." / "An <role> is a
   ... that ..." for the recent files (older ones use "This refers to"),
   23-43 words (median 28).  **Do not open by repeating the label**
   ("This means being grateful: ...").  Roger, 2026-09-27: every prompt
   that uses a description supplies the label right beside it
   (`**{positive_label}**. {description}` in the generator, the eval
   prompt and the pipeline judge; `**{name}**: {content}` in static
   judging; the axis name and examples in the axis rubric header, where
   the description is the pole text), so "X: This means being X: ..." is
   pure repetition.  Go straight to the behaviour ("This means noticing
   every kindness, ...") or open with a short gloss that paraphrases the
   trait and then expand it ("This means being drained by company and
   restored by solitude: keeping to oneself, ...").  Keep a label in the
   opening only when it carries a qualifier that picks the sense
   ("aristocratic about rank", "tough on people", "from the Eastern
   Hemisphere", "having a calm temperament").  An earlier version of this
   rule prescribed the label anchor, and 344 of the 390 descriptions
   written in September 2026 had it (2 of the 258 older ones); see
   `reports/seeding_log_2026-09.md` for the clean-up.
2. **The vice is a vice.**  No "appropriately", "when appropriate",
   "overly", "excessive", "too", "sometimes", "may", "can", "tends to",
   "healthy", "in a balanced way"; no virtue-framing of an edgy trait
   (irreverent is not "questions pretension", it jokes about the sacred and
   does not care) and no villain-laundering of a bad role (a destroyer
   destroys; a smuggler moves contraband for money).  A softened
   description samples the inoffensive centre of the concept and the
   pole then sits on top of an existing milder trait.
3. **Inside voice.**  Write in words the persona would use of itself:
   no case-worker, policy, clinical or anthropologist's vocabulary
   ("marginalised", "engages in", "exhibits", "demonstrates", "navigates",
   "individuals who"); name the particulars of the role's world (the
   tools, the customers, the hours, the enemy) rather than its category.
   For roles this matters most: the register of the description was found
   to propagate through the instructions into Qwen's responses.  For
   traits the instruction register does not propagate, but self-labelling
   does, so avoid handing the generator a paragraph it can quote back.
4. **Scope by a test, not by a list of synonyms.**  State what separates
   this pole from its nearest neighbours, ideally as one question the
   judge can ask ("would the persona do this if the setting were real?",
   "does the persona argue for continuing, or simply never ask?").  Check
   the nearest existing traits and roles before writing (nine names exist
   on both sides; `ls data/{traits,roles}/instructions`), and if the new
   entity is a deliberate near-duplicate of an existing one (a standard's
   version of a plain trait), say so in `source`, never in the
   description.
5. **Pairs are written together.**  Both poles get the same scope, the
   same trigger and the same length; the neg pole is an opposite, not an
   absence ("course-correcting", not "non-tunnel-visioned"), and where no
   opposite exists the seed keeps `non-X` and the antonym check decides.
   Name the mechanism that keeps two neighbouring pairs apart (motivated
   vs unmotivated; a frame believed not to count vs stakes believed high).
   **Do not name the partner in the description** (no "This means being
   X, never Y: ..."; no "The opposite of Y." tail).  Roger, 2026-09-25:
   naming the partner is a thumb on the clean-pair scale (the check is
   supposed to find the partner from the behaviour, and the label is
   already injected into the neg instructions) and probably pulls the two
   poles' description embeddings together.  It is a last resort for a
   pair that cannot be had any other way, recorded as such.  The
   pre-September corpus's "... rather than <opposite behaviour>" clause
   (86 of the 306 files at commit `93a8554`) is tolerated but should be
   used only where the word is polysemous and the contrast picks the sense ("temperate" about
   beliefs, not drink); prefer letting the body after the colon do the
   work.  The 2026-09-25 chunk-3 packets prescribed "never X"; 81 seeded
   files and the 3D drafts were stripped and rechecked on 2026-09-26 (see
   `reports/seeding_log_2026-09.md`).
6. **Standards.**  For a named instrument, paraphrase the canonical
   definition in the corpus form, keep the instrument's name out of the
   description, put the provenance in `source`, and label
   `<pole> (<Standard>)` (§ "Standard-derived trait labels").
7. **Things that are not the description's job.**  Questions and eval
   prompts are generated; do not steer them from the description.  The
   only exception is a scope sentence the questions must respect (for
   the frame pair: every question inside a stated frame), which goes in
   the queue entry's `description_notes` for the reviewer, not in the
   description.
8. **Sensitive entities** (the part-4 sensitive batch, the physical
   track, demographic memberships): the same rules; the description
   states the membership or attribute plainly and stops.  No disclaimers,
   no "respectfully".  The generator's refusals are handled at generation
   time, not by hedging the seed.
9. **Standards-derived entities (chunk 4 onward; Roger, 2026-10-06/07)**
   are written from the instrument's own text, not drafted from notes:
   locate an official description of the pole, record the passage
   verbatim with its URL and date in the queue entry (`source_text`,
   `source_url`, `source_retrieved`; the file's `source` carries
   instrument and URL), and summarise it into the form above.  Two
   departures from rules 2 and 5: **mirror the source's strength** (the
   vice rule and the hedge list do not apply to a pre-balanced official
   pair; do not sharpen a mild source or soften a strong one; render a
   psychometric hedge such as "tend to" or "rather" as its plain-word
   equivalent, not drop it; note a pole that comes out markedly milder
   than the corpus's plain traits), and **do not force the two poles into
   anti-parallel phrasing**: summarise each from its own source, and let
   a reviewer read both originals and both drafts and flag accidental
   differences of scope or phrasing for Roger to decide.  A low pole
   with no source text of its own is derived from what the instrument
   says about that side (its author's account of such people in the
   papers or the book, sources recorded on the queue entry), and only
   where the instrument says nothing from the high pole's content as
   opposite behaviour; either way it is tagged `low_pole_derived`.
   Roger, 2026-10-08: an official pair means what the theory means when
   applied to a persona, so a clause the instrument gives one pole
   (Gelfand's "need for structure, high regulatory strength") is kept and
   its counterpart derived, not cut.  When the instrument's site is gone,
   the Internet Archive's capture of its own page is the official text
   (record the capture date beside the URL; the CDX index with
   `filter=statuscode:200` lists the captures, and an `id_` URL returns
   the raw page), as for VALS.  Standards pairs are paired by
   construction; the antonym check is informational.  Worked examples:
   chunk 4 in `reports/seeding_log_2026-10.md` (sub-chunk A; the Gelfand
   and VALS items of the consolidated decisions).
10. **Memberships are insider portraits (Roger, 2026-10-08, chunk 5).**
   Nationalities, heritages, religions, disabilities and the like: "a
   realistic portrayal of the actual people, rather than stereotypes held
   by others".  Where the person is from and lives, the language at home,
   the everyday world (school, holidays, food, the media followed, politics
   as seen from inside), the way they speak of their own country or faith;
   no character or speech stereotypes, no emblem clichés, no disclaimers.
   The test: would a member recognise themselves, and wince at no clause?
   A clinical or neurodivergence entry is written the same way, from the
   inside, but must carry the condition's content (the impairment, the
   restlessness), not only its pleasant side; the label carries the
   diagnosis, so the description need not name it.  Proper adjectives in
   labels are capitalised (`American`, `East Asian`, `Buddhist`, `New
   Age`), as English writes them; the stem is unchanged.  Membership traits
   stay in English: native-language instructions would make the response
   language dominate the vectors (decided 2026-10-08; an `experiment` side
   set is in TRAITS_TO_ADD's chunk-4 post-extraction TODO, to be built before
   the extraction).
11. **States, dispositions and alternatives (Roger, 2026-10-08).**  A state
   is a trait only if it lasts years (trapped in a job, lonely, uninsured);
   one that lasts hours or days is rewritten as the habitual disposition if
   that is a gap, and dropped if not (distressed went: neurotic, anxious and
   melancholic covered it).  Write the duration in ("night after night",
   "for months").  A list of alternative manifestations is joined with
   "or", not "and" (the old or the young; which compulsion), and a clause
   that narrows the trait to a subset ("saying so to their faces") is
   dropped; the generator spreads "or" alternatives across the five
   instructions rather than requiring all of them.

**Trait generator V2: the next task, before chunk 4 (Roger, 2026-09-28).**  The rules
above govern descriptions; several problems found in the September
review are in the instruction generator instead (chatbot framing copied
from the template's own "the user" example, traits rendered as what the
persona urges on others, softened neg poles, states for tendencies).
Roger ruled out a small template tweak on 2026-09-16 and on 2026-09-28
said he is leaning toward a thorough V2 with a corpus-wide regeneration.
He deferred the decision until after the chunk-3 check-in, and once that
was made, the same day, put V2 on the task list as the next task, before
chunk 4 ("we'll do that next"), so that chunk 4 is generated once.  The
design is agreed with him before the template changes, and the
regeneration (about $19, about $40 with the pair recheck) goes through
the expensive-operations confirmation.
The issue list, evidence, cost and timing are in
`data/traits/instructions/TRAITS_ADDED.md` § "Trait generator V2", with a
design log.  Drafted 2026-09-29 as `--style RogerV2` in
`regenerate_trait_instructions.py` (voice left out on Roger's decision),
settled as draft 10 on 2026-09-30 (template `27a39ea285cb`), and **the
default style since 2026-10-01** (Roger: "make that the default behavior, and
require a flag to switch back").  `--style Roger` is the May 2026 production
rubric, `_ROGER_TEMPLATE_V1`, kept for comparison and rollback; do not edit
it.  The paragraph on verbs and particulars was a switch, `--no-concrete`,
until Roger settled it on 2026-09-30, and `--use-original-step-one` (May
2026) was stripped on 2026-10-01, both per § "Experiment switches in rubric
files: remove them once settled".  Until the corpus is regenerated under V2,
a trait regenerated for any other reason (a rename, a pair) comes out under
V2 beside V1 neighbours; the `generator` field tells them apart.

Writing-agent recipe (used from chunk 1 onward): give the agent this
section, the queue entries for one sub-chunk (label, partner, the
`description_notes` and `decision` fields, and any `description_draft`),
the nearest-existing table if one exists, and five recent corpus
descriptions of the same entity type as examples; ask for the description
plus one line naming the nearest existing entity and why it is different;
put the result in the entry's `description` field with status `ready`
only after Roger has read it.  **Reviewer findings (Roger, 2026-10-08):** a
reviewer line that identifies a real omission or error is applied as a fix
before seeding, not passed to Roger as a judgement; only genuine either-way
choices go to him, and they go in the chat, short, not as lines in a long
readout (the chunk-5 adhd gap had been filed as "Roger's call" and reached
him as an adjudication).

### Seeding tooling (chunk 0, Sep 2026)

`data/seed_queue.json` is the inventory of every candidate in
`TRAITS_TO_ADD.md` and `ROLES_TO_ADD.md` (built 2026-09-16 from the two
files by five extraction passes, then merged and checked against the
corpus; the markdown files stay the record of the reasoning, the queue
is the record of state).  One entry per entity with `stem`, `label`,
`entity_type`, `chunk`, `sub_chunk`, `pairing`, `partner`,
`arrangement_members`, `description_draft` / `description_notes` (from
the files) and `description` (final), `source`, `tags`, `status`,
`decision`, `alternatives`, `section` / `lines` (where in the files),
and, once run, `check_result`.  Status lifecycle
`candidate -> ready -> seeded -> generated -> checked -> paired | done`;
parked: `tbd`, `backlog`, `not_adopted`, `superseded`, `exists`.  Since 2026-10-08 a further final
status, `refused`: the generator model declined to write the instructions
(stop reason "refusal" or a prose decline; `data_analysis/generation_refusals.py`);
the generators record it in `data/{traits,roles}/generation_refusals.jsonl`
instead of retrying, `generate` copies the record into the entry's `refusal`
field, `check` skips it, and only `generate --retry-refused` tries again.
Roger's ruling (2026-09-08, 2026-10-08): a refusal is a data point, not an
error.

[`data_analysis/seed_entities.py`](./data_analysis/seed_entities.py)
drives it: `status`, `write` (seed JSONs for `ready` entries: traits get
`negative_label = non-<label>` unless `pair_by_construction`, roles get
`arrangement: singleton`; refuses to overwrite; runs
`sync_entity_lists.py`), `generate` (calls the two regenerate scripts;
prints the $0.03-per-entity estimate and refuses over $20 without
`--confirm-expensive`), `check` (runs `generate_antonyms.py`, classifies
each answer as nice / mismatch / nearly_nice / nasty / open against the
registry of existing *and queued* stems per the decision table below,
stores it in `check_result`), `rename --old X --new LABEL --partner Y`
(Roger's RO action: rename the existing trait to the word the check
returned, if free, regenerate it, re-check both sides; the file moves with
`git mv` and gets a `renamed_from` field), `pair --a X --b Y` (reciprocal labels,
`arrangement` pair on both, `--instructions-only` regeneration of the new
side, `check_arrangements.py`, `sync_entity_lists.py`) and `report`.
Every subcommand has `--dry-run`.  Tests:
`data_analysis/tests/test_seed_entities.py`.

The chunk-3 runs (2026-09-25/26) were driven by small scripts in the
session scratchpad, not in the repo: packet builders that assemble the
rules section above plus four post-strip example pairs and each entry's
queue notes for the writer agents; `run_pairs.py` (fold descriptions and
reviewer verdicts into the queue, `write` / `generate` / `check`, `pair`
the ones whose checks name each other, print the misses); `run_singles.py`
(the same for `non-X` singletons, recording the check answers for later
pairing); and the one-off strip / rename / edit rounds.  Their outputs
and every decision are in `reports/seeding_log_2026-09.md`; if the
pattern is needed again, rebuild from that log rather than hunting for
the scripts.  Two lessons worth keeping: a reviewer rename puts the entry
under two stems in a stem-keyed dict (deduplicate before `write`), and
the `check` answer is what the *checked* file's own description elicits,
so editing a pole changes only that pole's answer.

**Regenerate in a staging copy when Roger is editing (2026-09-28).**  The
regenerate scripts read a file, spend 20-60 seconds on the API call, and
write the whole file back, so an edit Roger saves in between is lost.
When he is reviewing files while a batch runs, copy the files to a
scratch directory, point `regenerate_trait_instructions.TRAITS_DIR` at it
(import the module and set the attribute; the usage record keeps its
repo path), run the check on the staged files with
`generate_antonyms.classify_one`, and merge `instruction`, `questions`,
`eval_prompt` and `generator` back only where the repo file's description
and label still match what was staged.  Skipped files are his edits:
rerun them.  The check is also noisier than a single run suggests: on
the 2026-09-28 recheck of 184 pairs whose content had not changed, 22
gained a one-way miss on a synonym, and a second regeneration brought 14
of the 22 back.  A single miss on a previously clean pair is weak
evidence: resample once before acting, and treat a miss that repeats
with the same words as real.

**Keep every sample (Roger, 2026-09-28).**  Record the antonym candidates
of every check, not only the latest, together with a copy of the
instruction set that check read: the candidates are more candidate
labels, and they are a measure of that particular generation.  The
record is `data/traits/antonym_check_history.jsonl`, one JSON object per
check, append-only, beside `instructions/` so nothing that globs the
corpus reads it: `stem`, `checked_at`, `phase`, the label the file had
when checked (normally `non-X`), `description`, `intended`, `returned`,
`candidates`, `known`, `category`, `intended_hit`, `score`, `reasoning`,
`instructions` (the pos / neg pairs read) and `generator`.
`seed_entities.py check` and `rename` append to it
(`append_check_history`, `check_history_record`) and add each answer to
the queue entry's `check_answers` list; `check_result` still holds the
latest.  Any ad-hoc runner must do the same, and must write the record
*before* the labelled `--instructions-only` regeneration overwrites the
instructions the check read.  The 385 records from 2026-09-27/28 before
this rule were backfilled with their candidates but without
instructions (not kept at the time).

Review order (Roger, 2026-09-17): writer agents draft, a review agent
checks, then seed and generate *before* Roger reads the descriptions, so
the antonym-check results accompany them; generation is cheap and a
regeneration after his edit costs three cents, while a round trip of
coordination costs more.  Only edits to existing files (labels, renames,
rewrites) wait for him.

### The TO_ADD and ADDED files: what moves when (Roger, 2026-10-09)

`TRAITS_TO_ADD.md` and `ROLES_TO_ADD.md` had grown into 5,700 lines of open
work, finished audits and design logs, with "TODO" and "TBD" markers on
sections long done, so that neither Roger nor an agent could tell what was
left.  On 2026-10-09 each was split: the TO_ADD file keeps what is unstarted
or part done, and finished work lives in `TRAITS_ADDED.md` /
`ROLES_ADDED.md` beside it.  This is an ongoing task: apply it whenever a
piece of corpus work finishes.

1. **Finished sections move; unstarted and part-done ones stay.**  Reference
   material counts as finished (a coverage audit's "not added, and why", a
   design log, measured evidence): it moves, and a ruling in it that binds
   future additions and is not already in this file gets one line in
   TRAITS_TO_ADD § "Standing rulings for future additions", with a pointer.
2. **The judgement call: a section that is mostly done but has one or two
   TODOs left.**  Leave it whole in TO_ADD until those are done, or move the
   bulk and write each remaining TODO as an item of its own in the TO_ADD
   index, saying what to do and pointing at the moved text
   ("TRAITS_ADDED § X").  Decide by relative size, and by whether the TODO
   can be explained without the rest of the section as context.  As applied
   on 2026-10-09: the 400-line dimensionality roadmap moved and its re-run
   became one index item; the housekeeping list and the leakage scan moved
   and their three and two leftovers became items; the chunk-4
   post-extraction section stayed, because most of it is still open and the
   two done bullets are short; the 66-entry Part 3 of the taxonomy import
   stayed, since its queue entries point at it.
3. **A parent whose subsection stays open** appears in both files: its
   heading and introduction go to ADDED, and TO_ADD keeps the heading with a
   status line saying what moved, so the open subsection keeps its parent.
4. **Headings never change, in either file.**  The queue's `section` fields,
   `assistant_axis/gapgen/physical_pass.py` and the trait-gap tools match
   sections by heading text.  Status goes on a line under the heading
   instead, `**Status YYYY-MM-DD: ...**`, dated, so a stale one shows its
   age.
5. **Moved text is moved verbatim**, stale markers, counts and broken links
   included (one link in TRAITS_ADDED points at a trait dropped in chunk 5);
   the head of each ADDED file says its markers are historical.  New
   sections are appended at the end of the ADDED file.  The 2026-10-09
   split kept the original order and checked by script that every line
   landed exactly once; a later single move is a cut and paste.
6. **Code can read these files.**  Before moving a section, grep the code
   for the file name: on 2026-10-09 Strategy 1's bracket scores, parsed by
   `assistant_axis/gapgen/persona.py` (from `calibrate_metric.py` and
   `test_gapgen_persona.py`), moved to TRAITS_ADDED.md and the two paths
   followed.  Live documents (this file, the READMEs, code comments) are
   repointed; old reports and seeding logs are left as they are, and the
   note at the top of each TO_ADD file sends "TO_ADD § X" readers to either
   file.
7. **Keep the index at the top of TRAITS_TO_ADD current.**  It is what
   Roger scans for what to do next: add an item when work opens, remove it
   when it is done, and keep the grouping (before, at and after the
   extraction; the tangle pass; parked for Roger; tooling).  ROLES_TO_ADD
   has a short index of its own.
8. **Sections written by the trait-gap session** (the standing pointers to
   its holding lists) stay in TO_ADD; tell that session before committing a
   move, since its tools print these file names.

### Corpus expansion policy and the clean-pair decision procedure (Sep 2026)

Roger's stated trade-offs for adding traits and roles (2026-09-09), written
down so the seeding rounds apply them consistently.  Correct here if wrong.

**Three competing criteria, roughly in priority order:**

1. **Gap filling.**  The goal is good coverage of the whole roles + traits
   set across a multi-dimensional persona space, without distorting its
   shape by oversampling one region (skewness matters), *except* that the
   goal-related and alignment / misalignment regions are deliberately
   sampled more heavily because they are what we most want to study.
2. **Pair creation.**  Clean pairs are currently more useful for judging
   and steering than triangles, simplices or sets (steering a triangle as
   three-or-more pairs and checking the resulting geometry is planned but
   harder), so a clean pair is worth somewhat more than two unpaired
   points.  The premium shrinks once the number of clean pairs is well
   above the effective dimensionality of the space (16-64 on current
   analysis; ~21 effective dimensions in the 60-axis cohort at
   2026-05-13), after which extra pairs mostly add redundancy.
3. **Rewriting an existing description** for better pairing or coverage
   (scope, emphasis, phrasing) is allowed but costs activation
   regeneration and rejudging, so avoid it unless the improvement is
   clear.

Outside the official external arrangements, be open to discovering that a
conceived pair is really a triangle or a larger arrangement; record what
the generator finds rather than forcing a pair.

**Where the neg instructions are actually used (verified 2026-09-09).**
Response generation (`assistant_axis/generation.py`) builds system prompts
from `instruction[i]["pos"]` only, so activations, vectors, axes, static
judging (descriptions + pos instructions), steering and the refusal
fallback never see a neg string.  The neg instructions are read by exactly
three things: `data_analysis/generate_antonyms.py` (the clean-pair
identification step), `data_analysis/classify_goals.py` (goal
classification of the neg polarity, which feeds the hand-built
`goal_roles_and_traits.json`), and `data_analysis/sample_trait_responses.py`
(a diagnostic sampler).  Consequence: a softened *neg* pole cannot distort
an existing vector; it can only mislead the antonym check and the goal
tiers.  Softening in a *pos* pole or a description is what reaches the
data.  Judge the audit flags accordingly.

**Official external arrangements are held to a looser pair standard.**  For
axes imported from a named instrument (Big Five, HEXACO, Inglehart-Welzel,
...), the pairing is fixed by the standard: set the two `negative_label`s
to each other by construction, so the checker sees a clean pair, and treat
the antonym check as *informational*.  Still run it: a failed check on a
summarised (non-canonical) description is a hint to adjust the wording.

**The antonym check needs a registry of existing *and proposed* names.**
`generate_antonyms.py` sees only the trait's own definition and
instructions and returns one or more candidate antonyms (`a|b`).  Interpret
its answer against the union of existing stems and the seed queue:

| generator returns | case | action |
|---|---|---|
| one word, and it is the intended partner (existing or queued) | the nice case | pair; point the labels at each other |
| one word, an existing or queued trait that is *not* the intended partner | mismatch | decide: relabel to the found partner, seed the intended one anyway as a sibling (triangle), or keep `non-X` |
| several words, exactly one of them existing or queued | nearly nice | usually pair with that one; note the alternatives |
| several words, more than one existing or queued (with or without the intended one) | the nasty case | judgement call; often a triangle or set; record the options in the queue entry, do not force a pair |
| no existing or queued word at all | open | seed the best new word as a completion, or keep `non-X` |

Having the full proposed list before seeding removes the sequencing
problem where a partner the generator names is one we planned to add
later.  Recorded decisions go in the seed queue entry (`decision`,
`alternatives`), not only in chat.

### The `arrangement` field (Sep 2026)

Every role and trait instruction JSON may carry an `arrangement` field
recording which set of same-type entities it belongs to and the shape of
that set.  Decided 2026-09-08; loader and validator in
[`assistant_axis/arrangements.py`](./assistant_axis/arrangements.py),
CLI check in [`data_analysis/check_arrangements.py`](./data_analysis/check_arrangements.py),
one-off backfill in [`data_analysis/backfill_arrangements.py`](./data_analysis/backfill_arrangements.py).

```json
"arrangement": {"kind": "pair", "members": ["callous", "compassionate"]}
```

or a list of such objects when the entity is in several sets (`malicious`
is one pole of benign ↔ malicious *and* one corner of the
compassionate / malicious / callous triangle).

| kind | members | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `singleton` | none | belongs to no set (explicit) |
| `pair` | 2 | one clean pair |
| `triangle`, `tetrahedron`, `N-simplex` (N ≥ 4) | 3, 4, N+1 | mutually opposed corners |
| `square` | 4 | two axes; the 2-cube / 2-orthoplex distinction is deliberately not kept (split into `square` / `diamond` later if it matters) |
| `cube`, `N-cube` (N ≥ 4) | 8, 2^N | every combination of N binary axes (MBTI's 16 types are a 4-cube) |
| `octahedron`, `N-orthoplex` (N ≥ 4) | 6, 2N | the poles of N clean pairs (HEXACO is a 6-orthoplex) |
| `ring` | ≥ 3, ordered | circumplex: neighbours close, opposites opposite |
| `tree` | ≥ 2, with `parent` / `children` | hierarchy (domains over aspects over facets) |
| `map` | ≥ 2 | unordered, expected to have low-dimensional metric structure (nationalities, ethnicities) |
| `sequence` | ≥ 2, ordered | roughly an axis with interesting deviations (the moral-circle group) |
| `set` | ≥ 2 | unstructured |

Numeric aliases are accepted and canonicalised (`2-simplex` → `triangle`,
`3-orthoplex` → `octahedron`, `2-cube` → `square`, ...).

Rules:

1. **Members are file stems, never labels**, include the entity itself,
   and are sorted, except for `sequence` and `ring` whose order is the
   content.  Every member records the identical arrangement.
2. **A missing field means not yet classified**; `singleton` is written
   explicitly, and **only for a trait whose `negative_label` is a `non-X`
   placeholder** (roles have no label).  A trait whose real-word label
   has no file, or points one way at a trait paired elsewhere
   (`inspirational` → discouraging, `subversive` → orthodox), stays
   unclassified: the label is a pairing still to be decided, and the
   checker rejects a singleton there (rule added 2026-09-17 after the
   agent had written two such singletons).  As of the 2026-09-08 backfill the not-yet-classified traits
   are the 142 with a real-word `negative_label` that has no file or is a
   one-way pointer (see TRAITS_ADDED § "TODO: antonym gap-filling pass");
   cleaning them up (pairs, triangles, sets, ...) is the tangle pass, TRAITS_TO_ADD
   § "TODO: arrangement hunting" (36 left on 2026-10-09).
3. **The pair convention is unchanged**: a clean trait pair is still two
   files whose `negative_label` fields point at each other.  The field is
   authoritative for *shape*; the labels stay the prompt-facing antonyms;
   the checker refuses to let them disagree (every `pair` must be
   reciprocal by label, every reciprocal pair must be recorded in some
   arrangement of a classified trait, octahedra / orthoplexes must
   partition into clean pairs).  Roles have no `negative_label`, so role
   pairs (angel / demon, predator / prey, ...) exist only here.
4. **Optional keys**: `axes` (the clean pairs forming the axes of a
   square / cube / orthoplex), `parent` and `children` (tree only),
   `source` (provenance of an imported structure), `note` (free text).
   Unknown keys are preserved.  **A pole of a clean pair that is also a
   member of a square / orthoplex carries both arrangements** (the list
   form): the `pair` always, because it is the prompt-facing clean-pair
   convention that rule 3 and the checker rely on, and the structure
   beside it with the pairs as its `axes`.  Decided for consistency on
   2026-10-07 (Roger: either always or never, so that code can rely on
   it); so written for the Big Five 5-orthoplex, the HEXACO 6-orthoplex
   and the Inglehart-Welzel square.  A cube or set of *unpaired* members
   (the MBTI 4-cube) has no pairs to carry.
5. **Check after every edit**:
   `uv run python data_analysis/check_arrangements.py` (exit 1 on any
   inconsistency; `--list-unclassified` prints the backlog).
   `assistant_axis/tests/test_arrangements.py::test_real_corpus_is_consistent`
   fails while the checked-in corpus is inconsistent.
6. **Research task, once embeddings exist**: confirm each declared shape
   is approximately descriptive of the embedding geometry (pairs as line
   segments that roughly intersect at a common centre for orthoplexes;
   the four off-pair segments of a square falling into two roughly equal,
   parallel, mutually orthogonal sets; sequences projecting monotonically
   onto their first principal direction).  Where it fails, reclassify,
   except that structures imported from an external system (HEXACO, MBTI)
   may keep their declared shape regardless.

### `data/goal_roles_and_traits.json` structure

Lists of roles and traits partitioned by goal content, for experimental use.
Each of `roles` and `traits` has `goal` (all-5 @ 2) and `non_goal` (all-5 @ 0) sublists.

**Ordering convention** -- items are randomized within tiers, tiers are concatenated:

- `roles.goal`: first 30 = primary set (varied), last 10 = cluster duplicates
- `roles.non_goal`: first 30 = most varied (max non-goal semantic spread), next 10 = nice-to-haves, last 30 = most redundant with first 30
- `traits.goal`: first 30 = max goal-space variation (less-HHH-default side of pairs, distinct ethical frameworks), next 10 = remaining moral circle spectrum, last 26 = default-side of pairs + redundant goal directions
- `traits.non_goal`: first 30 = max persona-property variation (less-default side of pairs), next 10 = nice-to-haves, last 17 = pair partners + redundant

### Trait-gap platform (2026-10-08)

The trait-gap platform ([`assistant_axis/gapgen/`](./assistant_axis/gapgen/), CLIs in
[`data_analysis/gap_generation/`](./data_analysis/gap_generation/)) turns the words that *generators*
(scripts proposing candidate traits: census lists, Roget, WordNet, LLM brainstorms) submit into seed-queue
candidates.  Three milestones: **M1**, the trait-hood filter
([`traithood_filter.py`](./data_analysis/gap_generation/traithood_filter.py) `--pipeline split`: is the
word a persona trait; its gloss, alignment score 0-3 and region); **M2**, the embedding metric
([`metric_config.json`](./data/candidates/metric_config.json): OpenAI `text-embedding-3-large`, the 10
nearest corpus traits); **M3**, the novelty check
([`novelty_score.py`](./data_analysis/gap_generation/novelty_score.py): retrieve, a relation call, then
one overlap call per pair; `covered`, `new` or `grey`); and the recovery harness
([`recovery_test.py`](./data_analysis/gap_generation/recovery_test.py): hide a tenth of the corpus, see
what a generator finds again).  Plans and readouts are in
[`reports/trait_gap_generation/`](./reports/trait_gap_generation/), starting from
[`coding_plan_platform.md`](./reports/trait_gap_generation/coding_plan_platform.md) ("Interface as built"
and the M3 decisions); the docstring of [`gapgen/__init__.py`](./assistant_axis/gapgen/__init__.py)
lists the frozen interface.  Models (M3 decision 17): every Haiku call is `claude-haiku-5-5` (M1's
verdict step reads three times); the second opinion and the unsure re-ask are Sonnet 5.5; the overlap
call is Sonnet 5.5 first, Opus 5.5 on the pairs the rule sends it.

The registry log [`data/candidates/registry.jsonl`](./data/candidates/registry.jsonl) is git-ignored, so
each checkout has its own (the tracked copy is
[`registry.snapshot.jsonl`](./data/candidates/registry.snapshot.jsonl), written by
[`gap_registry.py`](./data_analysis/gap_generation/gap_registry.py) `compact`).  A generator therefore
writes every `Candidate` it submits to a tracked `candidates.jsonl` in its run directory under
[`data/candidates/runs/`](./data/candidates/runs/) (one JSON object per line, exactly the dataclass's
fields, as `submit_candidates(..., run=ctx)` writes it; example:
[`antonym_check/pilot_1`](./data/candidates/runs/antonym_check/pilot_1/candidates.jsonl)), and a run made
in another worktree reaches the main checkout's log with `gap_registry.py submit --from <run
dir>/candidates.jsonl` (idempotent).  Costs: every paid CLI prints its estimate, takes `--budget-usd` as
a hard cap (an estimate above it is refused), needs `--confirm-expensive --confirmed-by` over $20 (the
expensive-operations rule: quote the parameters to Roger and wait for his go), writes a `usage.json`
beside its output, refuses uncommitted platform code without `--allow-dirty`, and runs live under about
$20 and through the Message Batches API above that, case by case (the batch-or-real-time rule).

### Combined response generation (pipeline)

The pipeline (`pipeline/1_generate.py`) supports two modes:

**Roger mode** (default): Generates combined role+trait instructions, standalone traits, and the default baseline. Uses `data/goal_roles_and_traits.json` to pick the top-N roles/traits from each goal/non-goal list.

- `r_{role}__{trait}` = goal role x non-goal trait (goal from role)
- `t_{role}__{trait}` = non-goal role x goal trait (goal from trait)
- Double underscore `__` separates role and trait in filenames
- Instructions are index-matched (pair 0-0, 1-1, ..., 4-4), concatenated with `\n`
- `--goal_count` / `--non_goal_count` (default 30 each) control how many items from each list; error only if a count exceeds BOTH lists it applies to

**Christina mode**: Processes standalone roles (or traits) from `--roles_dir`. Run separately per entity type (different `--roles_dir` and `--output_dir`) to avoid name collisions.

**Step 3 eval_prompt routing**: The judge (`3_judge.py`) requires an explicit `--entity_type {role,trait,combination}` flag to select the eval_prompt:

- `role` — look up stem in `data/roles/instructions/`, use its `eval_prompt` field.
- `trait` — look up stem in `data/traits/instructions/`, build a pipeline-specific 0-3 eval_prompt from the description. (The 0-100 `eval_prompt` in trait JSONs is NOT used by the pipeline, since `parse_judge_score()` rejects scores > 3.)
- `combination` — parse `r_<role>_t_<trait>` filename, build a compound 0-3 eval_prompt from both descriptions.

`default` is skipped under all entity types (step 4 uses all activations without scores).

**DO NOT try to autodetect entity type from the filename.** 9 names exist in both `data/roles/instructions/` and `data/traits/instructions/`:

    ascetic, contrarian, cosmopolitan, generalist, pacifist,
    patient, perfectionist, romantic, stoic

Any roles-first (or traits-first) fallback will silently mis-score one side for these 9. `run_pipeline.sh` passes the correct `--entity_type` per output-subdir type (Roger mode: `roles|traits|combinations`; Christina mode: inferred from `ROLES_DIR`). If you add a new standalone invocation of `3_judge.py`, you must pass `--entity_type` explicitly.

Steps 2, 4, 5 are unchanged — they process whatever files appear in their input directories.

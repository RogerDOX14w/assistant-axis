# Rule: entity-naming

**When:** keying or merging trait and role data by name, or displaying entity names.  Loads automatically for files matching the `paths` above.  Source: the sections of [`AGENT_NOTES.md`](AGENT_NOTES.md) marked `rule=entity-naming`; edit there, then run `uv run python tools/sync_agent_notes.py`.

## Trait/role name collisions and the `name|R` / `name|T` convention (May 2026)

**The bug we keep almost making.** Eleven names appear in BOTH the trait
and role lists (`ascetic`, `contrarian`, `cosmopolitan`, `generalist`,
`pacifist`, `parent`, `patient`, `perfectionist`, `romantic`,
`specialist`, `stoic`; nine in May 2026, `specialist` and `parent`
joined in September and were counted on 2026-10-09).  The list is
`COLLISION_NAMES` in
[`assistant_axis/tests/test_entity_id.py`](assistant_axis/tests/test_entity_id.py),
and `test_collision_names_match_the_corpus_on_disk` in
[`assistant_axis/tests/test_collision_regression.py`](assistant_axis/tests/test_collision_regression.py)
compares it with the stems on disk, so a trait or role seeded onto a name
the other kind already has fails a test until the list, the count and
these notes are updated.  In any
data structure that mixes traits and roles, the bare name is **NOT a
unique identifier**.  Historic code did things like:

```python
merged = {}
for entry in trait_scores: merged[entry["name"]] = entry["score"]
for entry in role_scores:  merged[entry["name"]] = entry["score"]  # silently overwrites!
```

…which silently dropped one side of every collision and biased downstream
ρ calculations by ~1.5%.

### Disambiguator: `assistant_axis.entity_id`

Use [`entity_id(name, kind)`](assistant_axis/entity_id.py) whenever a
data structure could plausibly contain entries from both kinds (dict
keys, set members, JSON cache keys, sorted name lists for rho, ...).
Format: pipe-suffixed single-letter kind tag.

```python
from assistant_axis import entity_id, parse_entity_id, display_label

entity_id("patient", "roles")    # "patient|R"
entity_id("patient", "traits")   # "patient|T"
parse_entity_id("patient|R")     # EntityId(name='patient', kind='roles')
display_label("patient|R")       # "patient"   ← bare name, for plots
```

Pure-kind contexts (e.g. inside `runpod_workspace/.../{roles,traits}/`,
or a per-cohort `haiku_responses_traits_*/` cache) keep bare names —
the kind is implicit in the path.  Disambiguation is for the **mixing
layer**.

### File-name vs display-name convention (underscores ↔ spaces)

Many entities have multi-word names that exist in two forms:

| form          | example                          | where used                         |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **file-name** | `aligned_artificial_intelligence` | every JSON key, dict key, set member, filename, scoring cache, ρ intersection key |
| **display-name** | `aligned artificial intelligence` | plot labels, axis annotations, **LLM rubric / prompt body**, console output for humans |

**Rule (Convention 2): file-name everywhere except display sites.**
Use the underscore form for any data-structure key, ID, intersection
operand, or persistence key.  Convert to space-form ONLY at the
boundary where you render the name to a human OR an LLM — and do
that locally (via the `display_form_name` helper or
`name.replace("_", " ")`).  Never the reverse: a display-form string
should never be used as a dict key, JSON key, or rho intersection
input.

**LLM prompts are display sites too.**  An LLM reading
`aligned_artificial_intelligence` parses it less naturally than
`aligned artificial intelligence` (extra tokens, distracts from the
concept).  Project-wide convention is therefore the same as for
plot labels: file-form is the canonical key, display-form is what
goes into the LLM's mouth.  Every rubric / prompt builder MUST
apply `judge_label(...)` (since 2026-10-09; `display_form_name`
before) to entity names before injecting them into the prompt body,
examples list, or axis-name header: § "Judge prompts show the judge
display form".

**Display helpers, chosen by audience (Sep 2026; prompts changed 2026-10-09).**

| helper | transform | use at | never |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `judge_label(stem_or_id, kind=None)` (and `judge_negative_label`, `judge_form_of_label`, `judge_form_of_negative_label`) | lookup as `corpus_display_name`, then a standard's suffix in the long form (`careless (HEXACO)` → `careless (from HEXACO)`, table `STANDARD_SUFFIX_FORMS`); unknown names mechanical | **every LLM prompt** that names a corpus entity: judges, scorers, checks, the instruction generators | dict keys, cache keys, ρ intersection operands, file names |
| `display_form_name(stem)` | mechanical `_` → space, no lookup | `judge_label`'s fallback for a name the corpus does not know; free-text axis names in the axis judge; legacy code | change its output: `judge_label` relies on it for byte-identical prompts of unknown names, and other code keys on it |
| `corpus_display_name(stem_or_id, kind=None)` | lookup: trait `positive_label`, role `ROLE_DISPLAY_OVERRIDES` (`devils_advocate` → `devil's advocate`), else mechanical | **human-facing text**: plot dot labels, pole labels, legends, console output | dict keys, cache keys, ρ intersection operands, prompt text |

Decision (Roger, 2026-09-07): the split stays as-is.  Prompts keep
the mechanical form (so static rubrics still read "systems thinker"
rather than "systems-thinker"); the effect on judging is small and
extending the lookup to prompts would be a rubric bump for no gain.
Revisited 2026-09-09: to be folded into the next full rejudge, see
§ "TODO: code housekeeping (Sep 2026)" item 4.  **Reversed 2026-10-09
(Roger, W19):** prompts show the judge display form, the stored label
with a standard's suffix in the long form, for every entity (§ "Judge
prompts show the judge display form"; axis judge `RUBRIC_VERSION` v4).

`corpus_display_name` accepts a bare stem or a `name|R` / `name|T`
id (the id supplies the kind); with no kind it consults both tables
and falls back to the mechanical form if a collision name ever
displayed differently per kind (today all eleven display identically).
Tables are read once per data dir from `data/{traits,roles}/instructions/`
(`$ASSISTANT_AXIS_DATA_DIR` overrides the location; call
`clear_corpus_display_cache()` after editing corpus JSONs in a
long-lived process).  The guaranteed direction is
`normalize_to_file_name(corpus_display_name(stem)) == stem` for every
corpus entity (tested over the whole corpus in
`assistant_axis/tests/test_entity_id.py::TestCorpusDisplayName`).
Switched to it 2026-09-07: `pair_slice_plots.add_label` (dots and
poles), `canonical_angles/ca1_plane.py` annotations,
`axis_pc_alignment_vs_peak_K.py` annotations.  Leave
`rubric_v1_v2_compare.py`'s 4-character abbreviations alone;
`infer_axis_description._display_label` (an LLM prompt site) uses the
judge display form since 2026-10-09.

**Spelling: US English in corpus text and file names (decided 2026-09-07).**
Labels, stems, descriptions and instructions use US spelling (`honor`,
`laborer`, `color`), because the corpus is LLM input and the generators
write US English; a UK-spelt stem would sit beside US-spelt generated text
and would not match the generator's own antonym suggestions.  Roger writes
UK English in notes and chat; convert when seeding a file.

**Standard-derived trait labels: `<pole> (<Standard>)` (Sep 2026; parentheses adopted 2026-09-09).**
When a trait or axis is imported from a named, well-known instrument
(Inglehart–Welzel cultural map, Big Five, HEXACO, Hofstede, Moral
Foundations, ...), the standard's name goes into the label as a
parenthesised, capitalised suffix and into the file name lowercased with
the parentheses dropped:

| `positive_label` (display, stored in JSON) | file stem (`normalize_to_file_name`) |
| --- | --- |
| `traditional (Inglehart-Welzel)` | `traditional_inglehart_welzel` |
| `secular-rational (Inglehart-Welzel)` | `secular_rational_inglehart_welzel` |
| `survival (Inglehart-Welzel)` | `survival_inglehart_welzel` |
| `self-expression (Inglehart-Welzel)` | `self_expression_inglehart_welzel` |
| `openness (Big Five)` | `openness_big_five` |

Rules:

1. **Pole first, standard second**, using the standard's own pole
   names and its own written form (`Big Five`, not `Big-5`; acronyms
   in caps, `HEXACO`).  Capitalisation is what marks the suffix as a
   proper name; there is precedent for capitals and spaces in labels
   (`Kantian`, `cultural relativist` as negative labels).
2. **`positive_label` is the canonical display form**; the stem is
   derived from it by `normalize_to_file_name` (lowercase, apostrophes
   dropped, hyphens and spaces → `_`, parentheses dropped, diacritics
   folded to ASCII so `Gemeinschaft (Tönnies)` → `gemeinschaft_tonnies`;
   stems stay ASCII
   because macOS and Linux normalise accented file names differently).
   The reverse is lossy in four new ways (capitals, diacritics, the
   hyphen inside a double-barrelled name, the pole/standard boundary), which is why plot text must go through
   `corpus_display_name`, never `stem.replace("_", " ")`.
3. **`negative_label` uses the full partner label**
   (`secular-rational (Inglehart-Welzel)`), so the antonym clause in the
   generation prompt and the clean-pair check both see the same string.
4. **Descriptions do not name the source.**  Paraphrase the canonical
   one-to-two-sentence definition (recognisable to anyone who knows the
   instrument; do not quote it verbatim).  Record provenance in an
   optional `"source"` field on the trait JSON instead, e.g.
   `"source": "Inglehart & Welzel, World Values Survey cultural map, traditional vs secular-rational values axis"`.
   Both regenerate scripts carry unknown fields forward.
5. **Import a standard's version only when its canonical definition
   differs materially from an existing ad-hoc trait, or when the
   comparison is the experiment.**  `conscientious`, `extroverted`,
   `introverted`, `agreeable`, `neurotic` already exist; a
   `conscientious (Big Five)` beside `conscientious` is deliberate
   duplication, not an oversight, and should say so in `source`.
6. Watch the generated instructions: the label is injected as the
   trait name and antonym clause, so the generator can leak the
   standard's name into a persona system prompt ("in the
   Inglehart-Welzel sense").  The description carries the substance;
   eyeball the pos/neg pairs and regenerate if it leaks.  If it
   recurs, add a per-trait generation-label override rather than
   changing the naming.  **Ruling (Roger, 2026-10-09): an instruction
   that names its instrument or author to fix the sense** ("in the
   Baumrind sense", "in the way Gelfand describes"; 2 of 425 positive
   instructions at that date, 0 after the W19 regeneration of
   2026-10-10) **is harmless: no reroll for it.**
7. **Prompts show "careless (from HEXACO)", not "careless (HEXACO)"**
   (Roger, 2026-10-07; done 2026-10-09, W19): `judge_label` inserts
   "from", with the sets that read better with the article or another
   form ("from the Big Five", "from Holland's RIASEC") in
   `STANDARD_SUFFIX_FORMS`; every prompt builder uses it, and the axis
   judge's `RUBRIC_VERSION` went to v4.  The stored label is unchanged.
   § "Judge prompts show the judge display form"; history in
   `reports/seeding_log_2026-10.md` § "TODOs for this chunk".

Multi-word entity census (qwen-3-32b Roger 8slot corpus): 12 of 303
traits + 4 of 281 roles = 16 of ~584.  Examples: `systems_thinker`,
`kind_to_animals`, `stream_of_consciousness` (traits);
`aligned_artificial_intelligence`, `paperclip_maximizer`, `coral_reef`,
`devils_advocate` (roles).

**The audit (May 2026)** found legitimate `_ → space` conversion
sites in the codebase, all in display/annotation code:
`canonical_angles/ca1_plane.py:193`, `pair_slice_plots.py:418`,
`infer_axis_description.py:164` (PC-describer LLM prompt),
`rubric_v1_v2_compare.py:209`, `regenerate_role_instructions.py:47`
(data-prep LLM prompt), and the `display_form_name()` helper.

**LLM rubric audit (May 2026)** of every prompt builder in the
project (8 callsites; each is now annotated in-file with a brief
display-form note that points back to this section).  Historical:
superseded on 2026-10-09 by the judge display form, whose site list
(the steering row included, now fixed) is in § "Judge prompts show the
judge display form":

| Prompt builder | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `axis_judge_correlation.py:build_static_prompt` | **fixed v3 (May 2026)** | Was injecting file-form `{name}`, examples, axis_name; now wraps each in `display_form_name(...)`. |
| `axis_judge_correlation.py:build_response_batch_prompt` | **fixed v3 (May 2026)** | Body anonymises the entity (v2); shared header still injected examples + axis_name in file-form, now in display-form. |
| `data_analysis/score_combinations.py:build_user_message` | **fixed (May 2026)** | Now wraps `combo['role']` / `combo['trait']` in `display_form_name(...)` at prompt injection. |
| `data_analysis/regenerate_role_instructions.py:build_eval_prompt` (+ Christina/Roger variants) | OK | Already used `role_display_name(stem)` (file-stem -> display, with overrides for `devil's advocate`). |
| `data_analysis/regenerate_trait_instructions.py:build_eval_prompt` (+ instruction variants) | OK | Already uses pre-stored display-form `positive_label` from each trait JSON (e.g. `stream-of-consciousness`). |
| `results_analysis/infer_axis_description.py:build_prompt` (PC-describer) | OK | Already used `_display_label` helper for trait/role labels. |
| `results_analysis/standardize_axis_spec.py:build_prompt` | OK | Operates on long-form pole *descriptions*, not bare entity names. |
| `assistant_axis/steering_judges.py` rubrics | **open** (low-priority) | Uses `persona.role` / `SteeringSpec.{axis_name,pos_label,neg_label}` as-is from steering config.  If config supplies file-form, prompts leak underscores.  Tracked separately; sweep configs to date have used clean labels.  Fix at SteeringSpec/PersonaSpec construction in `steering/{run_sweep,post_judge}.py`. |

**Cross-axis rejudge surface for the v3 fix** (35 distinct axis
dirs on disk across all pair lists, 57 distinct pole pairs across
all 9 `pair_list*.json` files): only **1** axis has multi-word
pole names — `systems_thinker_vs_analytical`.  So the
``axis_name`` + examples header leak is a single-axis problem
across the entire project, not just the v2 12-axis production
set.  The per-entity ``{name}`` leak in static-mode prompts
affects the 16 multi-word entities (12 traits + 4 roles, ~2.7%
of the corpus) on every axis.  Surgical rejudge cost: ~$0.49 for
the per-entity leak across all 35 axes; +$1.48 for the 1-axis
static header leak; +~$54 if redoing that one axis's response
mode at B=7 GPT + Haiku-tiered.

No internal pipeline produces or consumes display-name keys — every
ρ intersection, every set membership check, every cache key uses
the file-name form.

**Why no internal auto-conversion?**  Inside the pipeline we never
convert: every key is in file-name form by construction and any
mismatch is a bug, not user error.  Auto-coercing
`"aligned artificial intelligence"` → `"aligned_artificial_intelligence"`
in internal code obscures the mismatch and would fail anyway on
names where the user's word breaks differ
(`"obama_administration_health_team"` vs `"Obama administration's
health team"`).

**External boundary hardening (May 2026)**: the two ingest points
that accept names from outside the pipeline normalise display-form
input to file-name form with a WARNING, since the typical leak
(spaces, hyphens, capitals, apostrophes) is mechanical and easy to
detect:

1. `axis_judge_correlation.py --rejudge_names` —
   [`_parse_rejudge_names`](results_analysis/axis_judge_correlation.py)
   runs each name through
   [`normalize_to_file_name`](assistant_axis/entity_id.py); logs
   `WARNING: --rejudge_names: coerced N display-form entries...`
   when the input wasn't already canonical.
2. `optimal_axis_for_judge.py --scores_file` —
   [`_normalize_scores_file_keys`](results_analysis/optimal_axis_for_judge.py)
   runs every JSON key through `normalize_to_file_name`, logs
   `WARNING: --scores_file ...: coerced N display-form key(s)...`
   on conversions, and `SystemExit`s if two keys collide under
   normalisation (rather than silently dropping one).

`name|R` / `name|T` disambiguated ids are passed through unchanged
in both paths.  See `tests/test_entity_id.py::TestNormalizeToFileName`
and `tests/test_optimal_axis_for_judge_normalize.py` for the full
behaviour spec.

**Defensive checks already in place** for this risk class:
`StaleSchemaError` enforcement on AT-RISK static caches
(`assistant_axis/judge_loaders.py:478–533`), per-axis
`len(common) < 3 or 5` floors at every ρ site,
[`tools/lint_kind_collision.py`](tools/lint_kind_collision.py) AST
walker, and
[`assistant_axis/tests/test_collision_regression.py`](assistant_axis/tests/test_collision_regression.py)
covering 5 patterns × 11 collision names.

### Common-pitfall callout (read this before merging trait + role data)

Whenever you see this pattern in code:

```python
for kind in ("traits", "roles"):
    for entry in load_scores(axis, kind):
        merged[entry["name"]] = entry["score"]
```

**STOP.**  Replace with:

```python
from assistant_axis import entity_id

for kind in ("traits", "roles"):
    for entry in load_scores(axis, kind):
        merged[entity_id(entry["name"], kind)] = entry["score"]
```

…otherwise you are dropping eleven traits or eleven roles per axis.  The
canonical lint regex (`for .* in \("(traits|roles)", "(traits|roles)"\):`)
catches the dual-iteration pattern; pair every match with an
`entity_id(...)` call before the merge.

**At-risk cache families** (write disambiguated keys in mixed-kind
contexts):
* `<axis>/<judge>/scores_descriptions.json`
* `<axis>/<judge>/scores_instructions.json`
* `<axis>/<judge>/projections.json`
* `<axis>/<judge>/correlations*.json`

The per-cohort caches (`<axis>/<judge>_responses_<kind>_b<B>{...}/scores_responses*.json`)
are kind-pure by directory — bare names there remain correct.  Same for
`runpod_workspace/.../{roles,traits}/...` and any single-kind notebook.

### Producer-side / consumer-side audit (May 2026)

* **Producer**: `results_analysis/axis_judge_correlation.py` — writes
  the at-risk cache families above.  After the May 2026 fix it stamps
  disambiguated keys + `schema_version: 2`.  Old v1 caches are loud-rejected
  on read with a concrete regenerate-via command.
* **Consumers**: ~13 result-analysis scripts that merge trait + role
  data (see `phase3_consumers` in
  `trait_role_name_disambiguation_06e61abc.plan.md`).  Each migrated to
  `load_response_scores(...)` and `entity_id(name, kind)` keys.

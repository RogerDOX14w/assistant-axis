"""Transport choice for ``judge_tier_cost_eval.py`` (OpenAI Flex processing, the providers' batch
APIs, real time), over the one request layer, ``assistant_axis/judge.py``.

A model's requests, its Flex and retry behaviour, what a reply means and what a refusal or an empty
account does are all ``judge.py``'s, the code pipeline step 3 and the axis judge use; this module
re-exports them under the names the tool uses and adds what only the tool needs: which transport a
model goes by, and the two helpers its batch paths need.  Until the port of 2026-11-02 this was an
adapted copy, on a branch whose ``judge.py`` was two months old.

"""Judge axes from the entities' descriptions by the settled method.

The method, from the judge-tier evaluation of November 2026 (reports/judge_pareto/judge_tier_update_2026-11-01.md;
Roger, 2026-11-02, the judges revised 2026-11-03 and 2026-11-04): the batched percentile rubric (b10, the judge
places each entity by percentile among all of them on the axis), 20 entities per call, two passes, one each way,
no reasoning, each judge's passes averaged, for GPT-5.6 Luna, Haiku 5.5 and Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite; and since
2026-11-04 Jev (TypeSafe AI) beside them by its own method, two passes, one each way (Roger: "the new standard is
(Luna + Haiku + Gemini + Jev) x2, with the reversal in the x2"; JEV_* below, scripts/judge_jev_entities.py).  The
four are blended Luna 4 : Haiku 3 : Gemini 3 : Jev 24 (judge_score_combine.TIER_JUDGE_WEIGHTS_BY_MODE, the Jev
weight fitted on the 12 projection variants: reports/judge_pareto/jev_judging.md).  On the 61 axes, balanced
cells, slot 6, layer 25, raw (rho against the activation projections, cost per axis at the real price, Flex and
batch; scripts/judge_instruction_12way.py --mode descriptions):

    gpt-5.6-luna alone, 1 pass                                  0.709   $0.011
    the three, 2 passes each (the default from 2026-11-03)      0.751   $0.076
    Jev alone, 2 passes                                         0.758   $0.008    frontier in 12 of 12
    Luna + Haiku + Jev, 2 passes each                           0.766   $0.050    frontier in 12 of 12
    the four, 2 passes each (the default)                       0.766   $0.084    frontier in 5 of 12

Roger's rule (2026-11-03), chosen over picking among twenty arms a few thousandths apart: every model we have,
since the cross-model ensemble helps and varies by axis, and as many passes as the one text per entity needs
(a second pass of one judge adds 0.02 here, against 0.005 on instructions, which have five texts).  Luna's third
and fourth passes add 0.007 and 0.004 for the price of a second judge, which adds more.  Reasoning adds nothing to
any judge, and N=5 and N=7 are never on a judge's frontier.  The defaults below are that decision: change them
here, in one place.  Instruction judging has its own settled method, scripts/judge_instruction_grid.py.

Directions (Roger, 2026-11-04): a judge's two passes show each axis once in its own order and once with its
poles swapped (a coin per axis says which pass is swapped; the swapped pass's scores are mapped back), the
default since that day.  The pole-order test (reports/judge_pareto/response_judging_plan.md) found that the
order shifts the judges' placements and that a judge does better with the morally good pole at the high
number; a fixed order would carry that valence asymmetry into every result, so the directions are balanced
instead (and on axes without a good pole, one pass each way also beats two in one order).  --directions own
judges every pass in the axis's own order, under the old labels.

Each pass is a cell of judge_tier_cost_eval.py, <axis>_tier_eval/<judge>@b10n<N>d<seed>/ (s<seed> with
--directions own), whose every answer is saved as it arrives, so a stopped or failed run is simply run again.
Then each judge's passes are averaged into <judge>@b10n<N>dx<passes> (x<passes>), and the judges into
<judge>+<judge>@b10n<N>dx<passes>.  Projections come from
<experiments_dir>/<axis>/gpt/projections.json; for new data write them with

    uv run python results_analysis/axis_judge_correlation.py --projections_only --pair POS NEG --pair_type traits \\
        --data_dir DATA --output_dir <experiments_dir>/POS_vs_NEG/gpt

Check the cost first (--dry_run), then, for example:

    uv run python results_analysis/judge_descriptions.py --axes_file scripts/tier_eval_axes.tsv --budget_usd 20

Exit status: 0 done, 1 a pass failed or a source was refused for averaging, and otherwise the failing pass's own
status (judge_tier_cost_eval.py): 2 a budget stop, 3 a stall, 4 calls left unanswered: run again.

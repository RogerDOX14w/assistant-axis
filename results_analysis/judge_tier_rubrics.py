"""Rubric variants for judge_tier_cost_eval.py's description-mode axis judging
(``--rubric``, 2026-11-01).

The tier evaluation compares judges on one prompt: the v3 descriptions rubric
of ``axis_judge_correlation.build_static_prompt``, written on 2026-04-20 in the
style of 2023-era judge prompts (a seven-point table whose 0 row reads
"Neutral, ambiguous, or does not map onto this axis", two to three sentences of
reasoning, a SCORE line).  On 2026-11-01 the newer cheap judges were found to
answer 0 for 52-70% of entities against gpt-4.1-mini's 32%, and across judges
the share of zeros tracks lower rho (Pearson -0.85): the activation projection
orders every entity, and a 0 ties all the ones the judge would not place.
These variants test whether a rubric written for current models changes that.

Each variant: ``build(axis_spec, pair_type, etype, name, desc, show=None)`` ->
prompt; ``parse(text)`` -> score or None; ``version`` (recorded in each cell's
provenance and answer log, so cells of different rubrics never mix).

``show`` renders an entity's name (:func:`name_shower`).  Every prompt shows the
judge display form, ``judge_label``, as the project's other judges do (2026-10-09);
``--name_format mechanical`` reproduces the prompts of the cells judged before
2026-11-02, whose names only had underscores turned to spaces (``systems thinker``
for ``systems-thinker``: 13 of the May corpus's 583 entities, but 316 of the 1,272
of November's, ``achiever vals`` for ``achiever (from VALS)``).  It applies to the
contemporary and batched rubrics; ``v3`` and ``v3fix`` are ``build_static_prompt``'s.

- ``v3``: the existing rubric (``build_static_prompt``, ``parse_signed_score``,
  production's as they stand: names in the judge display form since v4, one
  ``SCORE`` marker required since v5).  Cells judged before the port of
  2026-11-02 ran the versions of September 2026, which showed mechanical names
  and read a marker-less reply's first integer.
- ``v3fix``: v3 with one fix.  The reference line named the pole entities by
  the type of the entity being scored ("roles that score near -3 include:
  indecisive" when a role is scored on a trait axis); it now uses the poles'
  own type.  Parser unchanged.
- ``c1`` to ``c4``: contemporary rubrics.  They say what the score is for
  (rank among several hundred entities, compared with an independent
  measurement; relative position and small differences matter a great
  deal), give a standard for indirect cases (typical behaviour, values and
  associations), keep 0 for genuinely balanced entities and ask for the lean
  otherwise, keep reasoning before the score (project rule), and read the
  score strictly: exactly one ``SCORE: <int>`` in range, else unparseable.
  ``c1``: -3..+3, one or two sentences.  ``c2``: -10..+10, one or two
  sentences.  ``c3``: -3..+3, one short sentence.  ``c4``: -10..+10, one
  short sentence.  Round 2, around c4: ``c5`` -100..+100; ``c6`` a few words
  of reasoning; ``c7`` a condensed prompt (input is most of a cheap judge's
  cost).
- ``is_*`` and ``i1_*``: instruction judging (2026-11-02): b10's percentile prompt with the entities'
  positive instructions in place of their descriptions, judged as sets (``is_``: each entity with all
  its instructions) or one at a time (``i1_``: one instruction per entity per round,
  ``--instruction_round``).  Each in six arms: wrapper ``p`` plain, ``q`` Markdown blockquote, ``t``
  bracket tags as production's judges use; ``0`` without and ``1`` with a sentence saying the text is
  to be assessed and not followed.

"""
Score a new judge model against an EXISTING, already-computed axis, without
recomputing activations, projections, or touching a GPU.  The Pareto investigation's
tool: every rubric, batch size, transport and request setting can be varied.  To
judge axes by the settled method, run judge_descriptions.py, which runs this.

Motivation: `axis_judge_correlation.py` unconditionally recomputes
projections from raw activation vectors (`--data_dir` is required), even
though those projections don't change when you just want to try a new judge
model -- they're a pure function of the (fixed) axis direction and the
(fixed) activation vectors, neither of which a new judge model affects.

Every axis under roger/axis_judge_experiments/ with a cached
`<axis>/gpt/projections.json` (61 of them; per-entity, per-slot, both-metric
projections, about 571-580 entities x 8 slots x {raw, whitened}) can be
re-judged this way.  scripts/tier_eval_axes.tsv lists all 61 with their
poles and pair type.

This script: loads a cached projections.json, judges the SAME entities'
descriptions with one or more NEW judge models (any --judge_model
axis_judge_correlation.py itself accepts), correlates the new scores
against the existing projections via the exact same compute_correlations()
/ Spearman machinery, records real measured cost in usage.json, and
writes output in the same shape axis_judge_correlation.py itself writes
(so it's a drop-in for downstream tooling expecting that layout).

Transports (--transport, default auto; added 2026-11-01):
  * flex      OpenAI Flex processing (service_tier="flex"): batch prices,
              answered like real-time calls.  All requests for all axes go at
              once through the rate limiter, on a client with a 900 s timeout
              and 8 retries; a request Flex keeps failing for 10 minutes is
              sent once to the standard tier.  Usage under <model>:flex, the
              fallbacks under <model>.
  * batch     The provider's batch API (OpenAI Batch API, Anthropic Message
              Batches; half price, results within 24 hours, usually within
              one).  One submission per model for all the axes being run;
              each cell is written as soon as its axis is complete; requests a
              batch never answered are sent in real time on the standard tier
              (up to --batch_fallback_max).  Work and state under
              <experiments_dir>/_tier_eval_batches/<model>/; a rerun collects
              batches still in flight before submitting anything.  Usage under
              <model>:batch, the real-time remainder under <model>.  Grouped and
              stacked runs (--axes_per_call, --axis_index, --stack) too, since
              2026-11-05: a group's axis-map entry lists its members, so a batch
              collected by a later run rebuilds the job; a batch's calls go into
              the submission one after another, so a chunk splits at most one
              cached prefix; the submission's estimated cost is logged first,
              since --budget_usd does not stop a batch.
  * realtime  Every request in real time through the rate limiter (the
              behaviour before 2026-11-01).
  auto picks batch for an Anthropic model, real time for a Gemini model; for an
  OpenAI model, flex when assistant_axis/judge.py's MODEL_CAPABILITIES says OpenAI
  takes it, batch when it says OpenAI refuses it, and when it is untested,
  flex with a probe: the first request alone on Flex, and a service-tier
  HTTP 400 switches the model to batch for the run (that request goes into
  the batch).  The choice is logged and recorded in each cell's
  scores_descriptions.json _provenance (transport, request_settings,
  max_tokens).

Request settings per model (reasoning effort, thinking) come from
assistant_axis/judge.py's JUDGE_REQUEST_SETTINGS, the requests pipeline step 3
sends.  --request_setting [MODEL_FRAGMENT:]key=<json> overrides the table for one
run.  Cells judged before the port of 2026-11-02 went by an adapted table, so to
extend one: 'gpt-5.6:reasoning_effort=null' for the cells of GPT-5.6 with no @none
in their label, and 'opus-5:output_config={"effort":"low"}' and the like for those
of Claude 5.

A batched reply that leaves members unread (a stop after the first lines, a form the parser cannot
read) is followed by the same prompt again, up to PARSE_RETRIES times, on every transport; each member
keeps the first reply that gives it a line, and what the last leaves unread goes unscored.  A refusal is
split instead, and a reply cut at the cap has its repair.  scripts/judge_tier_reask.py does the same for
cells already written.

Entity names in prompts (--name_format): judge_label, the project's judge display
form; "mechanical" reproduces the prompts of the cells judged before 2026-11-02.

Reply cap (--max_tokens, default 300 since 2026-11-01, Roger: "200 is clearly
too low for safety"; 200 before): a reply cut at the cap (Anthropic
stop_reason "max_tokens", OpenAI finish_reason "length") usually lacks its
SCORE line, and parse_signed_score's fallback would score it from a stray
number in its reasoning, so it is scored as missing without being parsed,
counted in the run summary ("truncated N") and as a failure in the parse rate,
and listed in the cell's provenance ("truncated", sorted entity keys).

Repair (--repair_truncated, 2026-11-01): for each finished cell of the given
models and axes, re-ask exactly the entities whose reply was cut at the cap,
in real time on the standard tier with the model's request settings, at
--max_tokens (equivalent to rerunning at that cap: a cap changes only the
replies that reach it), and patch the cell: those scores (a reply cut again
scores as missing), correlations.json, usage.json (the re-asks under the plain
model name) and a "repairs" record in the provenance.  The cut entities come
from the provenance "truncated" list; a cell without one is reported and left
alone.

Resume rule: an axis whose <output_dir>/<model>/usage.json exists is skipped
for that model (in both modes), so a rerun only judges what is missing.

Saved answers (2026-11-01, after a Flex run held nine hours of answers only in
memory): every billed live or Flex answer is appended, as it arrives, to its
cell's answers.partial.jsonl (a header with the model, cell label, rubric
version, request settings and reply cap, then one line per answer: entity,
reply text, cut at the cap or not, charges, a digest of the exact prompt).  A
rerun, by any transport, takes every saved answer to the same prompt instead
of asking again (and its charges into the cell's usage.json, not into this
run's budget), and refuses a log written under other settings.  Calls that
failed without a charge are not saved and are asked again.  When the cell is
written, the log is kept compressed as answers.jsonl.gz and removed.  So a run
can be stopped at any moment and rerun losing at most the requests in flight.

Instruction judging (2026-11-02; the is_* and i1_* rubrics): the same run with the entities' positive
instructions for text, the scores in scores_instructions.json.  An i1_* cell is one round
(--instruction_round R): one instruction per entity, each entity going through its instructions in its
own seeded order, so that no batch holds two of one entity's.

A batched call that comes back with nothing (a refusal, a content flag, an empty reply) has lost all
its members' scores, usually to one of them, so its two halves are asked, and so on down, on any
transport; the entity left alone without a score is listed under "refused" in the provenance, and each
such call is a "refusal" line in the answer log.  Batch API replies are kept in
batch_replies.jsonl.gz, since a batch's refusals are otherwise on record only as totals.

Live and Flex calls go axis by axis, at most --max_in_flight (200) at a time; a
progress line per model every five minutes; and when no answer arrives for
--stall_minutes (30) while requests remain, the run stops and starts itself
again (--stall_restarts, 3), resuming from the saved answers.

Usage:
    # All 61 axes, one or more models, preview cost (zero API calls, nothing written):
    uv run python results_analysis/judge_tier_cost_eval.py \\
        --axes_file scripts/tier_eval_axes.tsv \\
        --instructions_dir /tmp/corpus_2026-05-24/data \\
        --judge_model gpt-5.6-luna --judge_model claude-haiku-5-5 \\
        --dry_run

    # One axis (the original interface):
    uv run python results_analysis/judge_tier_cost_eval.py \\
        --pair angel demon --pair_type roles \\
        --projections_file roger/axis_judge_experiments/angel_vs_demon/gpt/projections.json \\
        --judge_model claude-opus-5 --judge_model gpt-5.6-luna \\
        --output_dir roger/axis_judge_experiments/angel_vs_demon_tier_eval \\
        --dry_run

    # Re-ask the replies a run's cells lost at the cap, at 300 tokens (preview first):
    uv run python results_analysis/judge_tier_cost_eval.py \\
        --axes_file scripts/tier_eval_axes.tsv \\
        --instructions_dir /tmp/corpus_2026-05-24/data \\
        --judge_model claude-sonnet-5 --repair_truncated --max_tokens 300 --dry_run

Drop --dry_run to actually run it.  scripts/run_tier_eval.sh wraps the
axes-file form with the corpus check.  Each --judge_model may be repeated;
models run concurrently.  Exit status: 0 done, 1 a model failed (or a key is
missing), 2 --budget_usd stopped the run, 3 it stalled and no restart was left,
4 calls stayed unanswered after their re-asks (rerun: cells with gaps have no
usage.json, and the saved answers are kept).

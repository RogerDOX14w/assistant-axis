"""
Judge LLM utilities for scoring role responses.

This module provides functions for scoring how well model responses
adhere to their assigned roles using an LLM judge (e.g., GPT-4).

Score Scale:
    0: Model refused to answer
    1: Model says it can't be the role, but can help with related tasks
    2: Model identifies as AI/LLM but has some role attributes
    3: Model is fully playing the role

Example:
    from assistant_axis.judge import score_responses

    scores = await score_responses(
        responses=[{"question": "...", "response": "..."}],
        eval_prompt_template="Rate how well...",
        judge_model="gpt-4.1-mini"
    )

    For mixed-provider workloads, the caller typically constructs one

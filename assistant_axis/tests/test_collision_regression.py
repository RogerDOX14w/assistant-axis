"""Phase 6 (May 2026) — regression test for the trait/role name
collision bug ("Bug A").

Pins down the canonical dual-iteration patterns that triggered Bug A
in 14 consumer files, demonstrating both:

1. The original bug (bare-name keys overwrite silently across kinds).
2. The fix (``entity_id(name, kind)`` keys keep both kinds distinct).

If a future refactor accidentally re-introduces the bug — typically
by iterating ``for et in ("traits", "roles"):`` and merging into a
single bare-name dict — these tests fail loudly.

The collision set is the 9 names that appear in BOTH the project's
trait corpus and its role corpus (May 2026 dataset).  Future dataset
edits may shrink or grow this set; if so, update :data:`COLLISIONS`
to match :data:`assistant_axis.tests.test_entity_id.COLLISION_NAMES`.
